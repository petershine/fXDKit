# fXDKit
Personal and Professional collection of implementations and snippets, which have been included in most of my projects, since 2012.


Currently, this kit is undergoing evolution, by translating sources from Objective-C to Swift, and adopting modern practices.\
And reorganizing to follow Swift Package standards.


## Installation

fXDKit is available using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
