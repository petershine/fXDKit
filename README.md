# fXDKit
Personal and Professional collection of implementations and snippets, which have been included in most of my projects, since 2012.


Currently, this kit is undergoing evolution, by translating sources from Objective-C to Swift, and adopting modern practices.\
Recently, this kit is reorganized to follow Swift Package standards.


## Installation

fXDKit is available using SPM (while using old fXDObjC as .xcframework) and CocoaPods.


To install using CocoaPods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'fXDKit', :git => 'https://github.com/petershine/fXDKit.git'
pod 'fXDObjC', :git => 'https://github.com/petershine/fXDKit.git' # Obj-C dependency
```


For the hosting app, import fXDKit like:
```swift
import fXDKit
import fXDObjC
```
